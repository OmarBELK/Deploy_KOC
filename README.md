# GenericML


This Project is about Creating a Geniric Machine Learning Engine, it helps non-data scientist select their 
historical data and type of ML algorithm and all parameters and hyperparameters they want include and start 
Learning the ML algorithm, the Engine returns metrics calculated automatically and helps the user whether to choose or to no the trained ML algorithm.
